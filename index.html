	<h1>
		Pushups
	</h1>
	<img src="pushups.jpg">
	<p>
		The pushup chiefly targets the chest, shoulders and triceps, the muscles on the back of the upper arm. In the chest area, pushups work the pectoralis major, the thick, slab-like muscles that span from the collarbone to the upper ribcage.
	</p>
	<h1>
		Military Press
	</h1>
	<img src="military.jpg">
	<p>
		The military press targets the deltoid muscles in the shoulders as well as the triceps. Additionally, it works the core and legs, which the lifter uses to help stabilize the weight. The lift begins with the lifter standing with both feet together and the barbell on the anterior deltoids.
	</p>
	<h1>
		Dips
	</h1>
	<img src="dips.jpg">
	<p>
		Recall that a dip is a pushing exercise that generally works the chest, triceps, and front shoulders. Thus, it's a good idea to combine Dips with pulling exercises that train muscles that work in opposition to the chest, triceps, and front shoulders. For example, one choice is to combine Dips with Chins or Pulldowns.
	</p>
	<h1>
		Pullups
	</h1>
	<img src="pullups.jpg">
	<p>
		Pull-ups work the brachialis and brachioradialis in the arms. These muscles are located near the elbow, and help move the forearm. The biceps brachii, or simply biceps, cross the elbow and shoulder joints and work to flex the elbow joint during the exercise.
	</p>
	<h1>
		Weighted Shoulder Shrugs
	</h1>
	<img src="shrug.jpg">
	<p>
		Although they are often called shoulder shrugs, the exercise primarily targets the trapezius muscle of the back. The barbell shrug is an isolation movement, meaning it utilizes just one joint. Shrugs should be part of a back workout that also includes compound movements such as lat pulldowns, pullups and rows.
	</p>
	<h1>
		Front and Side Shoulder Raises
	</h1>
	<img src="frontraises.jpg">
	<img src="sideraises.jpg">
	<p>
		The anterior deltoid, the supraspinatus and the trapezius muscles assist the lateral deltoids during the dumbbell lateral raise. The anterior deltoids sit at the front of your shoulders. The supraspinatus, located in the rear deltoid, initiates the abduction movement.
	</p>
	<h1>
		Bicep Curls
	</h1>
	<img src="curls.jpg">
	<p>
		The biceps curl is an exercise for the elbow flexors, which comprise the biceps brachii, brachialis and brachioradialis. You can emphasize each of these muscles by using a variety of grips. It is best to do biceps curls using dumbbells to ensure the elbow flexors of each arm are being worked to the same extent.
